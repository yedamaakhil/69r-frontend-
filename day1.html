    <p>Yadavs are a grouping of non-elite,peasant-pastoral communities or castes in India that since the 19th and
    20th centuries have claimed descent from the legendary king Yadu as a part of a movement of social and
    political resurgence.The term "Yadav" is now commonly used as a surname by peasant-pastoral communities,
    such as the Ahir of the Hindi belt and the Gavli of Maharashtra.
    
    Historically, the Ahir, Gopi, and Goala groups had an ambiguous ritual status in caste stratification.
    Since the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Yadav movement has worked to improve the social
    standing of its constituents through Sanskritisation, adoption of Yadav as a surname,active
    participation in the armed forces,expansion of economic opportunities to include other,more prestigious
    business fields, and active participation in politics.Yadav leaders and intellectuals have often focused on
    their claimed descent from Yadu, and from Krishna,which they argue confers caste Hindu status upon
    them,and effort has been invested in recasting the group narrative to emphasise a martial character,
    however, the overall tenor of their movement has not been overtly egalitarian in the context of the larger
    Indian caste system.Yadavs benefited from Zamindari abolition in some states of north India like Bihar, but
    not to the extent that members of other Upper Backward Castes did.</p>
